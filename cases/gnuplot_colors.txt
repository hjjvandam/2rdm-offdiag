GNUplot has default colors for the first three line types.
For a consistent representation I want to be able to select these colors
as needed. The first three colors are given below:

1 rgb "#9400d3"
2 rgb "#009e73"
3 rgb "#56b4e9"

Note that GNUplot also allows for transparency although GNUplot does not seem to
have a notion of what is "in front of" something else. With splot the "spatial"
ordering is that the last graph is the one most to the front, the first one the one
most to the back.

splot "h4_12.0_6-31g/r_h4_12.0-6-31g_aa_d_28.dat" lc rgb "#009400d3",
      "h4_6.0_6-31g/r_h4_6.0-6-31g_aa_d_28.dat" lc rgb "#a0009e73",
      "h4_3.0_6-31g/r_h4_3.0-6-31g_aa_d_28.dat" lc rgb "#f056b4e9"
